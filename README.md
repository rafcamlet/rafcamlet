## Hello everyone! I'm RafaÅ‚ ðŸ‘‹

- For the past decade, I have primarily been a backend developer (**Ruby on Rails** for life!), but I've had plenty of adventures with frontend:

- **Vue**, **React**, **Svelte**, **jQuery** - you name it! I even remember **CoffeeScript**! Although not very well. ðŸ¤”

- **Lua** fanboy and proud **Neovim** user. I've also made some [plugins](https://github.com/rafcamlet?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=lua&sort=stargazers) myself.

- From time to time, I try my hand at **C** (love/hate relationship with ATTiny13 Î¼C), **Go**, and **Rust**.
